I created the original HangMan game. The game is made in CodeBlock's using only C++. The project was made using STL, most specific vector class and string class and OOP. I made a class containing every function operating the word you give it. The program works easily: player 1 writes a word and player 2 has to guess it. Player 2 writes a letter and my program goes through the word and sees if it is in there. If it is, the program will add that letter to the "litereBune" vector which contains all the matches, otherwise, it will add it to the "litereRele" which is the vector for bad letters. Also, if your letter does not match, the "incercari" integer, which is set by default whit 6, will decrement, and if it goes down to 0, player 2 will lose the game. It also has a graphic interface, which shows you the curent state of the game ( shows you the little man hanging ).
